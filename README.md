# Online-Ticket-Booking-App
This Git repository contains a web-based movie seat booking application designed by me, featuring interactive seat selection, dynamic pricing updates, and responsive design.

## Movie Seat Booking System
This repository hosts a web-based movie seat booking system created by Shahmeer Bukhari. It allows users to interactively select seats for a movie of their choice, view seat availability, and calculate the total cost dynamically. The front-end utilizes HTML for structure, Bootstrap for responsive design, and custom CSS for specific styling. The core functionalities, such as seat and movie selection, booking, and dynamic updates, are handled by JavaScript.

## Key Features:

Movie Selection: Users can choose from a predefined list of movies, each with associated pricing.
Interactive Seating: Clickable seat map reflecting real-time seat availability across different movies.
Dynamic Pricing Calculation: The total price updates as users select or deselect seats.
Responsive Design: Styled with Bootstrap, ensuring the application is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
This system is ideal for demonstrating front-end development skills with a focus on user interaction, dynamic content management, and responsive design.
